# Welcome to the Quansheng_UV-K5 Wiki!

I have collected information about the amateur radio from various sources (Telegram Groups, You Tube, Github) and tried to bundle the information.
I would like to thank everyone who works on this "project".
I try to name sources as possible, but often I can't assign who was diligent. Comments and additions are welcome.

I would like to ask the two Spanish Telegram Channels to merge.
It makes little sense to distribute a few OM to two "equal" channels.
Just open a third channel and direct all users there ;-)
Here is my offer until we find a solution together!<br>
