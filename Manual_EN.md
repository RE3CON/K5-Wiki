# Menu Explanations
**SQL** – Squelch Level – 0-9 – Squelch is a feature of a radio that cuts the speaker when there is no transmission. It usually uses the presence of a carrier signal to detect a transmission and turn the speaker back on. In some cases, it can use an audio frequency as well. The squelch level determines how strong the detected carrier signal has to be before turning the speaker back on and ranges from 0 (off) to 9 (very strong) with the default being 4.
