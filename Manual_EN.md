# Menu Explanations
The radio includes a menu system that uses a short term to describe a function that can be somewhat unclear to users, especially users for whom this is their first radio. This explanation of the menu items should help all users understand each menu item.
* **SQL** – Squelch Level – 0-9 – Squelch is a feature of a radio that cuts the speaker when there is no transmission. It usually uses the presence of a carrier signal to detect a transmission and turn the speaker back on. In some cases, it can use an audio frequency as well. The squelch level determines how strong the detected carrier signal has to be before turning the speaker back on and ranges from 0 (off) to 9 (very strong) with the default being 4.
* **STEP** – Step Frequency – 2.5K/5K/6.25K/10K/12.5K/25K – Step frequency is the step from one frequency to the next when the up or down key is pressed in frequency mode. If you are at 300MHz and the step is 25K (Khz), then pressing the UP key once will give you a frequency of 300.025MHz. Smaller STEP sizes allow for finer control but require more key presses to make large changes in frequency. The default is 12.5Khz.*
