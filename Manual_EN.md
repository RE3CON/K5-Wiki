# Menu Explanations
The radio includes a menu system that uses a short term to describe a function that can be somewhat unclear to users, especially users for whom this is their first radio. This explanation of the menu items should help all users understand each menu item.
* **SQL** – Squelch Level – 0-9 – Squelch is a feature of a radio that cuts the speaker when there is no transmission. It usually uses the presence of a carrier signal to detect a transmission and turn the speaker back on. In some cases, it can use an audio frequency as well. The squelch level determines how strong the detected carrier signal has to be before turning the speaker back on and ranges from 0 (off) to 9 (very strong) with the default being 4.
* **STEP** – Step Frequency – 2.5K/5K/6.25K/10K/12.5K/25K – Step frequency is the step from one frequency to the next when the up or down key is pressed in frequency mode. If you are at 300MHz and the step is 25K (Khz), then pressing the UP key once will give you a frequency of 300.025MHz. Smaller STEP sizes allow for finer control but require more key presses to make large changes in frequency. The default is 12.5Khz.
* **TXP** – Output Power – LOW/MID/HIGH – This is the Transmit Power of the radio. While the actual values vary depending on the frequency, the basic values are Low - , Medium - , High – 5W.
* **R_DCS** – Receive DCS – (OFF,1-104:DCS, 105-208: reverse DCS). – Short Press F+* to trigger DCS to scanning. – DCS is Digital Code Squelch. It is a 3 digit binary code that is encoded in the audio transmission below at a low frequency and should be filtered out by the HT so it isn’t heard. It is used to control access to repeaters and other radios which won’t accept transmissions from radios not including the correct DCS code. While the option says it ranges from 1-208, the actual DCS codes are also shown on the menu for selecting. Pressing the F button and then the * button will start the radio scanning on the current frequency for DCS tones. When a tone is detected it is displayed on the screen and you have the option to save it. See Table 1 for a list of the codes for this radio.
* **R_CTCS** – Receive CTCSS – (OFF, 1-50:CTCSS) – Short Press F+* to trigger CTCSS scanning. - CTCSS is Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System. This system is older than DCS and uses a sub-audible tone added to the audio transmission to deactivate the squelch. Pressing the F button and then the * button will start the radio scanning on the current frequency for CTCSS tones. When a tone is detected, it is displayed on the screen and you have the option to save it. See Table 2 for a list of the codes for this radio.
