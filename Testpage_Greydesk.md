Thats a testpart from my english to german & german to Englisch translation with google.
I created the manual without the radio. You can delete that and get started yourself ;-)

Common user guide

◆ (6.1) Password protection at power on
     • Rotate the "Power/Volume Switch" clockwise to turn on this radio. If the program sets a password protection at power on, the screen will show "LOCK". The user must first enter the password before the radio can be used normally.

◆ (6.2) Main channel switching
     • Press the F+2 button to change the main channel. The solid arrow points to the main channel.
     • Press the PTT button to start TX on the main channel.
◆ (6.3) Dual band single scan/dual scan switching
     • The dual watch operation mode can be set in the menu. The method is: MENU → 17 → CHAN_A: The default TX channel is the A channel or CHAN_B: The default TX channel is the B channel. The screen will display "DW".
◆ (6.4) Frequency/Channel mode switching
     • On the main page, press F+3 key to switch between frequency mode and channel mode.
     • Frequency Mode: This mode allows users to manually input the RX frequency. Or you can press Up/Down button to adjust the frequency step by step. The parameter can be modified in the menu. In this mode, users cannot input the TX frequency. You can adjust the frequency or the direction of the offset frequency to change the TX frequency.
     • Channel Mode: Displays the actual channel number. In this mode, users can enter the channel number manually. Or you can press Up/Down button to change channel.

◆(6.5) Cross-band receive/transmit
The method is: MENU→18→WX, press MENU to enter the setting
OFF: Main channel broadcast When CHAN_A or B receives a valid call, the channel will automatically become the main channel until the call ends.
CHAN_A: Regardless of which channels are receiving valid calls, the default TX channel is channel A and the "DW" character is displayed.
CHAN_B: Regardless of which channels are receiving valid calls, the default TX channel is channel B and the "DW" character is displayed.

◆(6.6) Save channel
     • In MR mode, saving the channel is possible. You can copy the current channel to a new channel.
     • In VFO mode, you should first set the parameter of RX frequency, frequency deviation direction, wide/narrow bandwidth, RX/TX CTCSS/DCS, TX output power, whether to participate in scanning, DTMF code, scrambler, etc. set. Then press MENU→13→CH-001, and press MENU again to enter channel saving. Select the channel with the Up/Down button. Or you can use the number buttons to enter the channel number. Then press the MENU button again. The LCD display shows "SURE?". You can press MENU button to save the channel.
     • When you select the saved channel and CH-XXX is displayed, the channel is saved. If XXX is displayed, the channel is empty.

◆(6.7) Delete channel
     • Press MENU→50→CH-XXX, then press MENU again to enter delete channel. Select the channel you want to delete with the Up/Down button. Or you can use the keypad buttons to enter the channel number. Then press the MENU button again. The LCD display shows "SURE?". You can press MENU button to delete the channel.

◆(6.8) Receive and Transmit Tone Setting (CTCSS/DCS)

Process:
MENU → 4 → R-DCS Press MENU to enter and use up and down button to select the RX DCS code you want to set from the DCS list.

MENU → 5 → R-CTCS Press MENU to enter and use up and down button to select the RX CTCSS code you want to set from the CTCSS list.

MENU → 6 → T-DCS Press MENU to enter and use up and down button to select the TX DCS code you want to set from the DCS list.

MENU → 7 → T-CTCS Press MENU to enter and use up and down button to select the TX CTCSS code you want to set from the CTCSS list.

     • CTCSS/DCS is used to remove unwanted noise signals when receiving.

◆(6.9) Quick copy of a channel (Function as a frequency meter)
METER (FOR TWO-WAY RADIO DEVICES AND SOME OTHER DEVICES)
     • The fast copy requires a strong signal. Both the transmitter and the receiver should have an antenna installed. And their distance should not be too far.
     • Press F+4 to enter frequency measurement interface. When a strong signal is received, the LCD display will show the signal carrier frequency and the transmit channel (CTCSS or DCS). Press the * key to measure the frequency again.
     • After the effective frequency is measured, press the MENU button to save the currently measured frequency and transmit tone (CTCSS/DCS) to the specified channel.
